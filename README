Franq is a PyQt4 based reporting framework.

It supports page header and footers, multiple detail bands/datasets, sections, 
grouping, inheritance, etc.

Reports are designed as Python classes, then generated using any iterable as datasource,
and the result sent to printer or saved as a PDF or Postscript file.

While PyQt4 is required, it is not limited to GUI apps, can be used in console, web or
any other kind of application.

Franq is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.x, and is GPL3 licensed.
